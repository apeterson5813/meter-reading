# meter-reading

This is a collection of tools that I use to collect data from my home electric meter and then do some basic analytics. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Acknowledgments

The actual collection uses the following tools:

* [K-roy](https://blog.kroy.io/monitoring-home-power-consumption-for-less-than-25/) 
This project was inspired by this blog post and follows many of the steps outlined here.
* [rtlamr](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr)
The signal analysis is handled by this software.
